# epitools package

Here is an atom package for epitech's student.

His goal is to handle all the special things that you need for coding in C in epitech:

* headers
* indentation (a mix between tabs and space, like in emacs)
* norme (with linter)

And maybe some crazy things like :

* blih management
* intranet interface

For now, there is no very mutch to see. but i espect to make something basic within a month. So see you later ;)
