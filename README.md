# epitools package

Here is an atom package for epitech's students.

His main goal is to handle all the special things that you need for C programming in epitech with atom :

* headers generator and updater
* indentation (a mix between tabs and space, like emacs)

He could also implement some usefull behaviour :

* automatically turn-on when a headers is detect in the file, or chen you insert one
* check/correct indentation on save, open...
* suggest a project name for the headers based on the others sources files in the project

And maybe some crazy things like :

* linter for the epitech's C standard, especially for typo like scape at the end of a line
* blih management (save time and never forget ramassage-tek again)
* intranet acces within atom (for the timetable or the module list for example)

If you have some ideas, feel free to open an issue.

And don't forget : this is atom ! There is already thousand of packages, and this one only aim to supports epitech's specific requirement. So don't ask for a git support, an interface to gcc or a generic C linter, there is already packages for that out there.

For now, there is no very mutch to see. but I espect to make something basic within a month. So see you later ;)
