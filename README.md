# epitools package

Here is an atom package for epitech's students.

His main goal is to handle all the special things that you need for C programming in epitech with atom:

* headers generator and updater
* indentation (a mix between tabs and space, like emacs)

And maybe some crazy things like :

* linter for the epitech's C standard
* blih management (never forget ramassage-tek again)
* intranet interface (for the timetable or the module list for example)

And don't forget : this is atom ! There is already thousand of packages, and this one only aim to supports epitech's specific requirement. So don't ask for a git support, a interface to gcc or a generic C linter, there is already packages for that out there (git control).

For now, there is no very mutch to see. but I espect to make something basic within a month. So see you later ;)
